# udemy-clone
This is a simple Udemy homepage clone built using HTML5 and basic CSS. It replicates key layout features from Udemy’s homepage, including the course listings, categories, hero banner, and navigation bar. The goal was to create a clean, modular structure and enhance my front-end development skills through hands-on practice.

# What I Built :
A visually clean and modular homepage layout

Header with logo, search bar, and navigation icons

Hero section featuring promotional banners and CTAs

Category row for quick browsing of course types

Course cards styled to resemble Udemy’s product grid

Footer (planned for future update)

Though it currently lacks backend functionality and JavaScript interactivity, the layout uses semantic HTML and CSS Flexbox to reflect real-world design patterns.

# Why I Made This :
I created this project to :

Practice building structured layouts from scratch

Deepen my understanding of CSS layout techniques

Replicate a familiar UI to solidify my learning

Build a strong foundation before adding responsiveness or JS features

# Technologies Used :
HTML5 ,
CSS3 (Flexbox for layout)

# Work in Progress :
This version is not fully responsive yet — media queries and mobile support are planned for the next iteration. Future updates may include JavaScript-based interactivity and refined design for smaller 
screens.
